/*
 * A model supplying useful Draw-functionality.
 * Required settings:
 * - layerName: (string): The name of the layer that initially should be connected to the Draw-model.
 *   If it already exists a layer in the map with the same name, the model will be connected
 *   to that layer. Otherwise, a new vector-layer will be created and added to the map.
 * - map: (olMap): The current map-object.
 *
 * Exposes a couple of methods:
 * - getCurrentExtent(): Returns the current extent of the current draw-layer.
 * - getCurrentLayerName(): Returns the name of the layer currently connected to the draw-model.
 * - removeDrawnFeatures():  Removes all drawn features from the current draw-source.
 * - setLayer(layerName <string>): Sets (or creates) the layer that should be connected to the draw-model.
 * - zoomToCurrentExtent(): Fits the map-view to the current extent of the current draw-source.
